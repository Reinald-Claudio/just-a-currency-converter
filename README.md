# A simple salary converter

Super basic Python script I made for personal use.
Fetches the real-time currency exchange rate using Frankfurter's public API, and calculates monthly income after tax.

## What it does
- Live exchange rate lookup (Customize base/target currency of your choosing)
- Calculates monthly income (based on hourly rate x 160 hours)
- No sign-up and no API keys.
- ![What it looks like](https://github.com/Reinald-Claudio/just-a-currency-converter/blob/main/fixed-output.png?raw=true)

## Notes
- Made this for fun / backup purposes.
- No API keys needed - uses [Frankfurter](https://frankfurter.dev/) for free exchange rates.
- Please don't suspend my acc. again, GitHub Gods. üôè
