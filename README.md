# A simple salary converter

Super basic Python script I made for personal use.
Fetches the real-time currency exchange rate using Frankfurter's public API, and calculates monthly income after tax.

## Notes
- Made this for fun / backup purposes.
- No API keys needed - uses [Frankfurter](https://frankfurter.dev/) for free exchange rates.
- Please don't suspend my acc. again, GitHub Gods. 🙏
